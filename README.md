# BBM104_Assignments_Quizzes
Hacettepe University CS - OOP Lab. Explored various core concepts of OOP, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, alongside hands-on problem-solving tasks to build practical programming skills.

This repository contains my solutions to assignments and quizzes for the BBM104 - Introduction to Programming II course.

You can find the assignment descriptions and content in the PDFs, also sample input/output files in 'i/o' folders. 🤜🏻🤛🏻
